callcentric
===========

This is a site to keep track of browser extensions that augment the Callcentric dashboard.

## Features
1. Put a phone book icon next to calls made and calls received that already have been added to the Callcentric phonebook.

The Google Chrome Extension can be found at https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/callcentric-recent-calls/cgomdgoelkgkdhegmapgjfabcggphjgo.

The Firefox Extension can be found at https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/callcentric-recent-calls-ph/

## Future
Any ideas? I've currently scratched my itch.
